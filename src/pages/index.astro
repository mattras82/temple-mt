      <h3>Our History</h3>

      <p>
        Temple Muay Thai was founded on June 3rd of 2020 by Jesse Reyna, who has
        over eight years of experience in Muay Thai alone, including training,
        fighting, and coaching1. Jesse has trained under numerous highly
        experienced coaches from around the United States1. He started Temple
        Muay Thai in the parks of Asheville, North Carolina, with a few students
        and a lot of enthusiasm. Soon, he attracted more and more people who
        wanted to learn from him and join his vision. In 2021, Temple Muay Thai
        moved to its current location inside Oakley Wrestling Club at River
        Ridge market place1, where it continues to grow and thrive.
